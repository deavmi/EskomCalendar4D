eskomcalendar4d
===============

**eskomcalendar4d** provides DLang users with a simple but functional (in the ease-of-use sense) API client that makes use of the [eskom-calendar API](https://github.com/beyarkay/eskom-calendar-api) in order to provide you with a way to build ontop of it.

## Usage

Firstly you will need to add the dependency to your project, this can be done as follows:

```bash
cd <your project>/
dub add eskomcalendar4d
```

In terms of using the API there are a few examples [here](https://eskomcalendar4d.dpldocs.info/v0.1.3/eskomcalendar.calendar.html) (scroll to the bottom of the page) which show you how to use it.
